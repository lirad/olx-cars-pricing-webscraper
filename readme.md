# Walmart Mexico Barcode Crawler

This project is crawler made to fetch data from the Walmart Mexico website site from a list of barcodes selected by the user. 

My version of the Slack bot will return basic concepts of ruby as a reminder to you. For example if you type @your_bot strings, you'll be led to a wiki page of ruby strings. Same works with arrays, classes etc. For full list of commands type @your_bot help in your channel
